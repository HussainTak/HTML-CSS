    <li> <p>The South American dreadnought race took place in the early twentieth century between Argentina, Brazil and Chileâ€”the three most powerful and wealthy countries in South America. In 1906 the revolutionary British warship HMS Dreadnought made all existing battleships obsolete. Brazil ordered three Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts (lead ship pictured). These warships would be the most powerful in the world. The incomplete third vessel was sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1913 over economic concerns and a fear that it would be outclassed by even larger super-dreadnoughts. Meanwhile, Argentina and Chile ordered two dreadnoughts each: of the Rivadavia class in 1910 and Almirante Latorre class in 1911, respectively. The outbreak of World War I ended the naval arms race. The Brazilian super-dreadnought Riachuelo was canceled, the two Chilean dreadnoughts were purchased by the British, and Argentina's two dreadnoughts were completed in US yards.
